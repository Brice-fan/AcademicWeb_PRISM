  abstract = {This paper studies how robotization affects multinational production (MP), trade and country welfare. While robot adoption reduces production costs and enhances efficiency, its effect on global production structures and welfare distribution remains unclear. Using cross-country data, we show that robot adoption is positively correlated with both inward and outward MP, and that more robotized countries are more likely to engage in reshoring, where domestic production expands faster than outward MP. We develop a multi-country, multi-sector general equilibrium model incorporating trade, MP and labour–robot substitution to interpret these patterns. Through three counterfactual simulations, we show (i) global robotization improves world welfare but generates highly unequal gains; (ii) targeting robotization to mid-level robot adopters yields more balanced global outcomes than concentrating it in advanced economies; and (iii) MP frictions significantly shape how robotization spreads its benefits across borders. Our contribution lies in linking robotization to the structure of MP and trade and in quantifying how the distribution of robotization across countries and the openness of production networks determine global welfare.},

First, the results of the econometric model find that a good country image promotes FDI. 1% increase in the country image (positive response ratio) is associated with an increase of 1.955% in logarithmic FDI stocks. Second, several robustness test, IV estimations and dynamic panel estimations all have proved this promoting effects. Third, counterfactual analysis indicate that the drop of country image during 2007-2011 incurs the U.S. 0.052%-0.064% loss of total welfare, which cost the country 1.924%-2.339% of its total gains from openness. In contrast, the consistent improvement of China’s country image between 2009 and 2012 has amounted to more than 0.878%-1.174% of its total welfare gains from openness.}

  abstract={This paper studies the innovation driving force of servitization in manufacturing industry on firms' internationalization based on a theoretical perspect，and utilizes hand-matched data of Chinese listed manufacturing companies from 2007 to 2013. The results show that servitization of manufacturing industry improves extensive and intensive margins of firms' OFDI. Servitization of manufacturing industry brings positive influences on dual margins of OFDI by enhancing innovation capacity in intermediate good sectors to improve productivity. In addition，“going global” brings market-seeking,efficiency-seeking，and technology-seeking motivation to the industry．Knowledge-intensive also nonstate-owned enterprises adopt professional sci-tech services to push themselves “going global”．We suggest that the supply-side structural reform in China should focus on advancing the servitization process of manufacturing industry to strengthen firms' competitiveness，and ultimately facilitating the global of internationalization},

This paper investigates the numerical stability of high-order Runge-Kutta (RK) methods when applied to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation. We derive rigorous stability boundaries for symplectic and non-symplectic RK integrators and demonstrate that specific implicit schemes preserve unitarity over extended simulation times. By analyzing the spectral properties of the Hamiltonian operator, we establish a relationship between the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition and the imaginary eigenvalues characteristic of quantum propagators. Our findings are validated through simulations of wave packet scattering and harmonic oscillator dynamics, showing that our proposed optimized RK coefficients significantly reduce phase error accumulation compared to standard integrators.},

This work bridges the gap between classical analytic number theory and geometric invariant theory, offering new insights into the distribution of prime polynomials. The constructive nature of our proof allows for the algorithmic verification of L-function properties for curves of genus g > 100, which was previously computationally intractable.},

This study employs extensive Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase transitions of the 2D Ising model mapped onto hyperbolic lattices (Poincaré disk). We utilize the Wolff cluster algorithm to overcome critical slowing down near the phase transition temperature. Our results indicate that the critical exponents on negatively curved surfaces deviate significantly from the standard Onsager solution for flat Euclidean lattices. Specifically, we observe a suppression of the correlation length divergence, suggesting a mean-field-like behavior induced by the exponential expansion of the lattice volume. These findings have implications for understanding quantum gravity models and holographic duality.},

Furthermore, we derive a priori estimates that ensure the global regularity of the solution almost surely. A key contribution of this work is the treatment of non-Lipschitz coefficients using a stochastic Gronwall inequality, extending the applicability of the theory to more singular physical models.

This paper analyzes the algorithmic complexity of contracting Tensor Networks, specifically Matrix Product States (MPS) and Projected Entangled Pair States (PEPS), when applied to MBL Hamiltonians. We prove that while the exact contraction is #P-complete, approximate contraction schemes based on singular value decomposition (SVD) truncation exhibit polynomial time complexity with bounded error for short-time evolution. However, we identify a "complexity phase transition" at the ergodic-MBL transition point, where the bond dimension required for a fixed accuracy diverges exponentially. We propose a novel adaptive bond-dimension algorithm that optimizes computational resources by exploiting the area law of entanglement in the localized phase, demonstrating superior performance on Heisenberg spin chains.},
